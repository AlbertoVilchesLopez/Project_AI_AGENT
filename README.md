#   AI AGENT

## DESCRIPTION
 This AI Agent works like an assistant virtual doctor. You can explain and answers the following questions and get the sintomactics. The most important part is the solution to combat the sick.

## LIBRARIES
 To deploy this project, you need to implement the following libraries: 
  - OpenAI
  - Streamlit
  - FPDF

## PITH
Did you know that over 60% of primary care consultations could be effectively resolved without the need for an in-person visit? Our healthcare system is critically overburdened, compelling many to seek immediate answers when an unexpected symptom arises. In such moments, immediate access to medical guidance can be the critical factor that distinguishes between peace of mind and undue anxiety—or even between timely intervention and a delayed, potentially critical, response.

This is precisely where Sanea comes in—our AI-powered family medical assistant. Engineered to provide a reliable preliminary diagnosis, Sanea analyzes symptoms, suggests potential causes, and recommends immediate self-care measures. Crucially, if it detects a potential emergency, it advises consulting a physician and can even provide their direct contact number.

Sanea is not intended to replace healthcare professionals. Rather, it serves as a dependable first line of triage, helping to alleviate the strain on the healthcare system and providing crucial peace of mind in situations where time is of the essence or access to a medical facility is restricted.

However, this is merely the beginning.

Sanea's potential is vast. We envision future iterations featuring real-time virtual consultations, integrated appointment scheduling, personalized health records, and even seamless integration with wearable devices for continuous health monitoring. Ultimately, Sanea is poised to become the indispensable digital health companion that everyone carries in their pocket.

Because health doesn't wait.

Sanea: When it's urgent and can't wait... but you need answers now.
